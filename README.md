# Project Calculator

**Project Introduction**
A calculator is a fundamental tool used in various fields of mathematics, science, engineering, and everyday life. The Simple Calculator project involves building a basic calculator application that allows users to perform simple arithmetic calculations. The calculator will have a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and additional functionality like All Clear, equals, and Delete Fuction. Users can input mathematical expressions, and the calculator will display the result.

**Project overview**
Developing a calculator project can be an excellent way to learn programming, improve your problem-solving skills, and create a practical application that can be used by others. In this introduction, we'll provide an overview of what a calculator project entails and discuss the key components you should consider. When developing a calculator project, you will design and implement a user-friendly interface for users to input mathematical expressions and obtain accurate results.
